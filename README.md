# protobuf-survey
A repository of .proto files for studying protobuf usage. We are especially interested in protobufs that are used in the critical path (e.g., for serving requests, not for recovery, logging).

### How to add your .proto file
1. Create a new folder
2. Add .proto file(s)
3. Add a README.md with the following info:
  * Is your protobuf for network or storage?
  * If possible, add a link to your code that uses the protobuf file
4. Submit a pull request

### Disclaimer
This is a public github repo that we will leave available to other researchers working on protobufs. PLEASE DO NOT upload non-open-source code here!!
